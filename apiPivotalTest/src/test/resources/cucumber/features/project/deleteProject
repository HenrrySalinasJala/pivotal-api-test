Feature:Delete project

  Background: set connection to pivotal tracker API REST
    Given I have set a connection to pivotal tracker API service
    And I have the next parameters to create a project:

      | name   | project to delete |
      | public | true              |
    And I have the /project endpoint
    And I send a project POST request

  Scenario: Create project
    Given I have a project created
    When I send a project DELETE request to /projects endpoint
    Then I expect the status code 204
