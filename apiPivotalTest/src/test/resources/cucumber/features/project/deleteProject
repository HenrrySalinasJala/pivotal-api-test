Feature:Delete project

  Background: set connection to pivotal tracker API REST
    Given I have set a connection to pivotal tracker API service
    And I have the next parameters:

      | name   | project to delete |
      | public | true              |
    And I have the /projects endpoint
    And I sent a POST request
    And stored as Project1

  Scenario: Create project
    Given I have a project created
    When I send a DELETE request to /projects/[Project1.id] endpoint
    Then I expect the status code 204
